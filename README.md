## What is special about Code Buddy?

Code Buddy is designed to be completed by anyone. No computer experience is required.

Coding is something that I am passionate about and I want to share that passion with anyone who is interested! Whether they are my 80 year old grandma or a 10 year old on their dad’s computer, I want them to be able to complete the course and learn a thing or two. 

Other educational coding websites can be a bit intimidating to beginners. I know because I was one! Code Buddy’s instructions are written in plain english and are as basic as possible.

This app allows the user to write their own code and play around. They can
see their own code displayed immediately, which creates a helpful source of feedback.
